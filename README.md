**Unsupervised Analysis of Human Activity
Recognition Data Using PCA and K-Means**

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in applications such
as health monitoring. This work applies two unsupervised learning techniques,
specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering, on the
UCI HAR dataset. This dataset contains inertial sensors data from a waistmounted smartphone on 30 subjects performing daily living activities. We aim to
reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining the meaningful information,
and to identify the activity clusters using K-Means. Additionally, we visualize the
inertia values to find the elbow point which helps determining the optimal number
of clusters. Furthermore, we compare it to the original number of classes provided
in the dataset.
